# Codingame Contest Spring 2022
My code for the Codingame Contest Spring 2022.<br>
The goal of the contest is to create an AI that will beat the bots of the other players.<br>
In this contest I used complex logic and <b>DFS</b> to simulate best movement and possible situations. <br><br>
<b>Contest Description</b><br>
You control three heroes that defend your base from monsters. The monsters get spawn randomly across the map and walk in a straight line. The game ends after 220 turns or if your base or the opponent's base has been attacked by monsters 3 times.
Your goal is to have more lives than your opponent. In order to protect from the monsters you can damage them by being near them or you can wind, control or shield monsters or heroes.
The game is of course more complicated than this as player can use multiple strategies and there are many variants to the game that I haven't mentioned.
